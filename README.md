# fandom
fandomers is a social network for fans spread their passion and support towards fandoms. One of fandomers' first landing page concepts. The initial visual identity chosen by the platform's founder was cyberpunk. This was a project developed by two technology people and two mentors. I was given the mission to develop the front end and work on web design. I also developed the logo and it's guide. This platform is timeless (fans never break down) and will have a visual identity in a random module.
